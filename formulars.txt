The Complete Daily Commission Calculation (With Pre-Configured Fee Rate)

Step 1: Calculate Daily Activity from Balances

    Cash-In (CI) = Closing Cash - Opening Cash
    CI = C_c - O_c

    Cash-Out (CO) = Opening E-Money - Closing E-Money
    CO = O_e - C_e

Step 2: Calculate Total Fees Generated

    Total Fees (F) = Cash-Out × Pre-configured Fee Rate
    F = CO × R
    (where R is the fee rate, e.g., 0.01 for 1%)

Step 3: Calculate Agent's Commission

    Agent Commission = Total Fees × Agent's Commission Rate
    Comm = F × K
    (where K is the agent's rate, e.g., 0.55 for 55%)
